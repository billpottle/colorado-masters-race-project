Analysis of uploaded PDF files
I would like you to go through the attached PDF files which have track meet results. 
You should extract the individual performances, create a new copy of the outdoor-track-data.csv file, and then insert one row for each individual performance.
You should only include results from athletes 30 years old and older. 
All data should be consistent with the rest of the data in the sheet. 
For instance, '100m' and not '100 meters'. 'male' instead of 'men' or 'man' etc. 
The included events should be 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 1600m, 1 mile, and the 3000m steeplechase. 
If the event is not in the list, do not add it (for instance field events or hurdles or relays) 
The date of the event should be found in the title of the file or somewhere on the page. 
All results in one file will have the same date.

Agent Mode for Single Race Result

I would like you to go through track meet results at <url>
You should extract the individual performances, create a new csv file, and then insert one row for each individual performance.
The columns in the file should be 'Name', 'Time', 'Age', 'Meet Name', 'Gender', and 'Event'
You should only include results from athletes 30 years old and older. In some cases, these will be listed under 'masters' divisions.
If the race is specifically a masters race, but you cannot find age of a runner, then list their age as 'masters'. If it is not a masters specific race and you only have a division (for instance '65-69') then just use that division. 
If the race is not specifically a masters race and you do not see an age listed for a runner, just skip them. Do not search other sources to confirm a runner's age. 
If a race is specifically NOT a masters race, ie '100m 9-10' would be for 9 to 10 year olds, you can ignore it completely and do not need to click on it. 
If there is an 'a' or 'm' after time, please skip this and reply with just the number. 
All data should be consistent with the rest of the data in the sheet. 
For instance, '100m' and not '100 meters'. 'male' instead of 'men' or 'man' etc. 
The included events should be 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 1600m, 1 mile, and the 3000m steeplechase. 

Name should be 'firstname lastname' with no commas. 

If the event is not in the list, do not add it (for instance field events or hurdles or relays) 
The date of the meet is July 25th, 2025 and the meet name is Denver Twilight Series - the finale
All results in one file will have the date and meet name
