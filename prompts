Analysis of uploaded PDF files
I would like you to go through the attached PDF files which have track meet results. 
You should extract the individual performances, create a new copy of the outdoor-track-data.csv file, and then insert one row for each individual performance.
You should include all ages of athletes. 
All data should be consistent with the rest of the data in the sheet. 
For instance, '100m' and not '100 meters'. 'male' instead of 'men' or 'man' etc. 
The included events should be 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 1600m, 1 mile, and the 3000m steeplechase. 
If the event is not in the list, do not add it (for instance field events or hurdles or relays) 
The date of the event should be found in the title of the file or somewhere on the page. 
All results in one file will have the same date.
